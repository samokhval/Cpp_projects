Simple Scanner lets you scan file by path and search byte sequences from file "base.in". The sequences are stored in the regular text file separated
by newlines, in the following format:HexString.{GUID} 
Examples:
01ABEDFF55.{ab306a70-0fd2-4b4b-84fe-f9ebd899d90f}
EE21DEAD827739ACCD028FFC.{5c34b10f-3f6d-4bbb-b9ec-2faa1ee07660} 
Result will be shown after scanning and saved to the file "result.out"
